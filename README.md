# pedestal.ions ![CI](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal.ions/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

[Datomic Ion](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/ions/ions.html)
interceptor chain provider. To learn more about Ions, checkout the
[docs](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/ions/ions.html).

## Getting the latest release

Clojure [tools.deps.alpha](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha):

```
{io.pedestal/pedestal.ions {:git/url "https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal.ions.git"
                            :sha "56070e360295f3359a6300a2d27858e0a125188b" 
                            :tag "0.1.3"}}
```

## Caveats

Going async either by returning a channel instead of a Context map or
response body is currently not supported.

## Usage

1. Declare the `io.pedestal.ions/ion-provider` chain provider in your service map.
1. Create a fn which constructs an ion handler fn from the service map.
1. Create your ion by ionizing  your handler.
1. Whitelist your ion in the `ion-config.edn` resource file.

### Example

```
;; src/my_ion/example.clj
;;
(ns my-ion.example
    (:require [io.pedestal.http :as http]
              [io.pedestal.http.route :as route]
              [io.pedestal.ions :as provider]
              [ion-provider.datomic]
              [ring.util.response :as ring-resp]
              [datomic.client.api :as d]
              [datomic.ion.lambda.api-gateway :as apig]))

;; Routes elided
(def routes ...)

;; 1. Declare the `io.pedestal.ions/ion-provider` chain provider in your service map.
;;
(def service {:env :prod
              ::http/routes routes
              ::http/resource-path "/public"
              ::http/chain-provider provider/ion-provider})

;;
;; 2. Create a fn which constructs an ion handler fn from the service map.
;;
(defn handler
  "Ion handler"
  [service-map]
  (-> service-map
      http/default-interceptors
      http/create-provider))

;;
;; 3. Create your ion by ionizing your handler.
;;
(def app (apig/ionize (handler service)))

;; resources/ion-config.edn
;;
;;
;; 4. Whitelist your ion in the `ion-config.edn` resource file.
;;
{:allow    [my_ion.example/app]
 :lambdas  {:app {:fn my_ion.example/app :description "Pedestal Ions example"}}
 :app-name "my-ion-example"}
```

Check out the [Pedestal Ions Sample](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal-ions-sample) project for
a fully functional sample and [example](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal-ions-sample/blob/master/deps.edn)
`deps.edn` configuration.

## Parameters

Datomic Ions provides facilities for accessing system
parameters. Refer to the [Ion Parameters](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/ions/ions-reference.html#ion-parameters)
docs for an overview. The `io.pedestal.ions` namespace provides an interceptor fn, `datomic-params-interceptor`,
which makes these these parameters available on the Pedestal Context. Include this interceptor in your commons interceptor collection
to enable parameter support. If included, this interceptor makes parameters available on the Context through the following keys:

- `:io.pedestal.ions/app-info`      Contains the results of `(ion/get-app-info)`
- `:io.pedestal.ions/env-map`       Contains the results of `(ion/get-env)`
- `:io.pedestal.ions/params`        Only present if the `:get-params?` option is provided.
                                    Contains the results of `(ion/get-params {:path path})`
                                    where `path` is calculated using :app-name and :env
                                    from `app-info` and `env-map`, respectively. Param names are keywordized."
